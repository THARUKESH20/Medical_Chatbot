This project implements an intelligent healthcare chatbot using LangChain, Streamlit, and Hugging Face models. The chatbot is designed to help users ask questions related to mental health and provide informative responses based on a PDF document containing relevant information. Using LangChain, the chatbot processes a PDF document on mental health, splits the text into chunks, and creates embeddings with Hugging Face models for efficient similarity search with FAISS. It utilizes a conversational memory, allowing the chatbot to maintain a history of interactions for more personalized responses. The chatbot is built on Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for users to query the system. The setup involves cloning the repository, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the Streamlit app. The user inputs a question, and the chatbot retrieves the most relevant answers from the document based on the conversation history, delivering informative responses. This project is customizable, allowing for the integration of different pre-trained models and text-processing techniques for document-based conversational agents.
